/**
 * This page is gated and should only allow access for wallets have logged in and pass the "gate condition"
 * The gating condition for a wallet address is up to you. Usually we check:
 * 1. If a wallet address owns a certain NFT
 * 2. If a wallet address owns some ERC20 tokens
 * 3. If a wallet address owns some NFT/ERC20 tokens and the owned balance must be greater than a certain amount.
 *
 * To make it clean, we put the logic in a function called `hasAccess(wallet: string)` which returns a boolean.
 * If `TRUE`: The users can access the page's content.
